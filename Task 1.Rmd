<!-- Workshop Task Description -->

<!-- The Wheat Seeds Dataset contains measurements of seed kernels from different varieties of wheat: Kama (1), Rosa (2) and Canadian (3). High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique and 7 measurements were taken which are in this order in the file: -->

<!-- Area. -->
<!-- Perimeter. -->
<!-- Compactness -->
<!-- Length of kernel. -->
<!-- Width of kernel. -->
<!-- Asymmetry coefficient. -->
<!-- Length of kernel groove. -->
<!-- Investigate whether these variables might be useful to classifiy the species. -->

```{r reading in the data}

library(tidyverse)

wheat <- read.table("data-raw/seeds_dataset.txt") 
```

```{r organising the data}
# Adding column names

colnames(wheat) <- c("Area", "Perimeter", "Compactness", "Length of kernel", "Width of kernel", "Asymmetry coefficient", "Length of kernel groove", "Variety")

# Cleaning the column names and adding a column for names of the variety

wheat_tidy <- wheat %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(variety_name = ifelse(variety == "1", "Kama",
         ifelse(variety == "2", "Rosa",
         ifelse(variety == "3", "Canadian", "NA"))))
